          <h2>A Snippet of George</h2>
          <p>My passion for technology has been a constant in my life. From being a child playing video games, to an adult who just has to have the newest and greatest devices, I've always enjoyed discovering and learning about new advancements in tech. I taught myself to code a bit of HTML and CSS when I was just 13 years old, but later in my life I set my passion for coding aside and pursued other careers.</p>
          <p>Now I'm back and reinpsired to again pursue my love of coding at <b>Thinkful</b>! I am so happy to rejoin the coding community and work with thousands of developers from around the world together on future projects!</p>
          <p>Coding is not my only passion though, here are a few other things that I enjoy:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Travelling the world</li>
          <li>Learning new languages</li>
          <li>Picnics in Central Park</li>
          </ul>
